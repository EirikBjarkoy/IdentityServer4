# IdentityServer 4

This project is not maintained anymore and is now archived.

IdentityServer4 is a free, open source [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect/) and [OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) framework for ASP.NET Core. It went out of support when .NET Core 3.1 end of support was reached (13th Dec 2022).

Originally founded and maintained by [Dominick Baier](https://twitter.com/leastprivilege) and [Brock Allen](https://twitter.com/brocklallen), the IdentityServer4 project was forked as [Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) and is now maintained and supported as a commercial product with a [Community Edition](https://duendesoftware.com/products/communityedition) available.

IdentityServer4 contains multiple known security vulnerabilities and bugs, and has outdated documentation. As explained in more detail on the [Duende blog](https://blog.duendesoftware.com/posts/20250306-identityserver4-public-again/), the decision was made to archive the IdentityServer4 repository and code in the current [DuendeArchive](https://github.com/DuendeArchive) GitHub organization.

Issues are read-only and can still be consulted. The IdentityServer4 code is available in the [`archive`](https://github.com/DuendeArchive/IdentityServer4/tree/archive) branch:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DuendeArchive/IdentityServer4.git
git checkout archive
```
